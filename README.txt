    -Use terminal to cd into this cloned directory from Github

BRIEF EXPLANATION OF DESIGN CHOICES:
    -This Blackjack simulator is a simple text game using the 
Random and OS library.
    -Simple functions were used to simulate the game and lists 
were used to represent the deck of cards.
    -Future developments can include creating a user interface with 
graphics, implementing suits for each card, providing the double
down feature, and betting.
    -Extensive testing and all case consideration can be implemented
    for each function in the program; however, for such a simple
    program, I chose to test informally via the I/0.
