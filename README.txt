-This Blackjack simulator is a simple text game using the 
Random and OS library.
-Simple functions were used to simulate the game and lists 
were used to represent the deck of cards.
-Future developments can include creating a user interface with 
graphics, implementing suits for each card, providing the double
down feature, and betting.
